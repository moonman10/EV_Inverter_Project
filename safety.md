# Safety — Day 1 Baseline

## Quick rules
- One-hand rule when probing live circuits.
- Battery switch (hard DC disconnect) within reach.
- Logic E-Stop (NC contact on ENABLE) tested before each run.
- Fuse on DC+ close to source (start 10 A @ 24 V bring-up).
- PSU current limit = 2–3 A for first power-ups.
- Eye protection, no metal jewelry, tidy bench.
