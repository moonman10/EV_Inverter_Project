Day 1 Notes: Downloaded CCS and nessecary motor lab software. Ordered materials including fuses and fuse holder, e-stop, 12 awg silicon wiring, xt60 connectors, 4mm bullet connectors, cable zipties, heat shrink tubing, M3 standoff kit, RoMuka button switch, BOOSTXL-DRV8320RS gate driver, LAUNCHXL-F280049C Launch Pad, and of course the D5065 Dual Shaft Motor (270kv). (This will not be all of the materials needed but it is a good start)
Day 2 Notes: Created Github repository and got organized with files. Mapped out a day 1 diagram of the target system. Added to hardware. This will could change in the future but for now it helps to understand how the system works. Created a safely checklist for the power supply bench. Added to safety.
