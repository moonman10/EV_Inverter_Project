Day 1 Notes: Downloaded CCS and nessecary motor lab software. Ordered materials including fuses and fuse holder, e-stop, 12 awg silicon wiring, xt60 connectors, 4mm bullet connectors, cable zipties, heat shrink tubing, M3 standoff kit, RoMuka button switch, BOOSTXL-DRV8320RS gate driver, LAUNCHXL-F280049C Launch Pad, and of course the D5065 Dual Shaft Motor (270kv). (This will not be all of the materials needed but it is a good start)
Day 2 Notes: Created Github repository and got organized with files. Mapped out a day 1 diagram of the target system. Added to hardware. This will could change in the future but for now it helps to understand how the system works. Created a safely checklist for the power supply bench. Added to safety.
Day 3: Most of materials arrives but not enough to start building, I will wait until I am at Cal Poly to start that. Created a BOM for the project. Added a glossary to notes with quick explanations of what different parts are. Added a desionions page with a mission plan. Created a CCS compiler user tutorial for general use and how to use with a CAN transciever in software. I used CHATGTP for this as it was for my own use as I am totally new to this interface.
