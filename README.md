# EV_Inverter_Project
Low-voltage 3-phase inverter (TI F280049C + DRV8320RS) with FOC, regen, and safety features. A six month long individual project with the goal of developing testing and refining a complex system. At the heart of this project was the montra "Learn by Doing" that is synonymous with the school I attend.
