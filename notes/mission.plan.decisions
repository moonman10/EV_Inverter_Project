Mission Plan:
The goal of this project is not to just spin a motor using an inverter system. That is part of it of course, but what I am really after are two things. One is to gain experience working with both hardware and software, in a way that relays into my main career interest (Electric Vehicles). The second goal is to become more comfortable optimizing systems and learning to not be satisfied with the initial design. 
Okay with that out of the way, two house keeping items. Item number one, timeline. I will complete this project by the end of 2025 (possibly earlier) with an official start date of September 4th. I consider this the start date because that is when I initially had the idea to do this project. Item number two, cost. I will pay for all resources myself but also try to be diligent on using what my school (CAL POLY SLO) has to offer. 
You may be wondering, what inspired me to do this project? It has everything to do with what I mentioned earlier. I have always loved cars and I am certain that that is what I want to put my lifes work into. As an electrical engineering major, I want to work on the electrical side of electric vehicles. I recently watched a run down video on a Lucid Air Sapphire motor. When they explained how the inverter must convert DC to 3-phase AC, I immediatley wanted to know exactly how that process worked. This project will offer a more intuitive perspective of that system than simply learning from videos/professors/books could on their own.
